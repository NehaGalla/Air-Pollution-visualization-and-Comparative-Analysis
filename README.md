# Air-Pollution-visualization-and-Comparative-Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes air quality data for major cities and states in the United States. It uses the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API to fetch current air quality data for various pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, and O3 for several US state capital cities and New York City. The project then visualizes this real-time data on a map using Plotly to show the dominant pollutant and its value in each location.

Additionally, the notebook includes code to analyze historical air quality data for the years 2011-2021 from Excel files stored in Google Drive. It focuses on the mean NO2, maximum 8-hour Ozone, and weighted mean PM2.5 levels in various Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). Heatmaps are generated using Seaborn to visualize the trends of these pollutants over the years for the top 50 CBSAs based on their mean pollutant values.

In summary, this project provides both a snapshot of current air quality in select US cities and an analysis of historical pollution trends across different CBSAs, utilizing external APIs and local data files for comprehensive air quality visualization and analysis.
